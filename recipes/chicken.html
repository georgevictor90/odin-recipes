  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious. Succulent. Juicy. Tender. And all the other adjectives you can think of to describe the perfect roast chicken. I’m not sure there are too many meals that make you feel as much like a domestic goddess as roasting a chicken. Your home fills with the incredible scent of chicken, vegetables, and herbs and you only had to spend about 15 minutes getting it ready.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup margarine, divided</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
      <li>Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
